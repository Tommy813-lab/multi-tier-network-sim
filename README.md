Multi-Tier Network Simulation
This project is a hands-on simulation of a realistic multi-tier network architecture. Itâ€™s designed to give anyone â€” from students to cloud professionals â€” a clear view of how layered cloud environments are structured and secured. The project combines architecture diagrams, threat modeling, automation scripts, and a screenshot generator so you can visualize your network setup instantly.

If you want to learn cloud architecture and security in a practical way, this project is a strong starting point.

Whatâ€™s Inside
Realistic Network Design â€” Simulates a three-tier structure: Web layer, Application layer, and Data layer.

Visual Assets â€” Architecture diagrams and network flow charts that clearly explain how the tiers connect.

Security Insights â€” Threat modeling document covering vulnerabilities and mitigation strategies.

Automation Scripts â€” Tools to deploy, clean up, and capture screenshots of the simulation.

How to Use
Requirements
Linux or macOS environment

Git

Docker (optional for containerized simulation)

AWS CLI (optional for cloud deployment)

Steps
Clone the project:

git clone https://github.com/charles-bucher/multi-tier-network-sim.git
cd multi-tier-network-sim
Explore the /diagrams folder to review existing architecture and flow charts.

Review threat_model.md for detailed security considerations.

Deploy the simulation:

./scripts/deploy.sh
Capture screenshots of the simulation or diagrams:

./scripts/screenshot.sh
Clean up resources:

./scripts/cleanup.sh
Screenshot Script Details
screenshot.sh automatically captures visuals of your simulation and saves them to /diagrams/screenshots/. This helps document network states at different stages and creates reusable assets for presentations and reports.

Example usage:

./scripts/screenshot.sh
Output location:

diagrams/screenshots/
