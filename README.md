ðŸŽ¯ PROJECT OVERVIEW
This project demonstrates a [REMOVED]-grade VPC architecture that follows AWS networking best practices. It's not just "create a VPC and some subnets"â€”it's a fully segmented, secure, and scalable network foundation that enterprise applications are built on.
Why This Matters
VPC design is the foundation of everything in AWS. Get this wrong and you'll face:

âŒ Security vulnerabilities (exposed private resources)
âŒ Routing nightmares (misconfigured route tables)
âŒ No scalability (poor CIDR planning)
âŒ Compliance failures (no network segmentation)

This project proves I understand network architecture at the infrastructure level, not just "click buttons in the console."

ðŸ”¥ KEY FEATURES
ðŸ” Security by Design

Public/Private subnet separation - Internet-facing vs internal resources
Network ACLs - Subnet-level firewall rules
Security Groups - Instance-level stateful firewalls
Private subnets have no direct internet - All outbound via NAT Gateway
Bastion host architecture - Secure SSH access to private resources

âš¡ High Availability

Multi-AZ deployment - Resources spread across 2+ availability zones
Redundant NAT Gateways - One per AZ for fault tolerance
Independent route tables - Per-subnet routing for flexibility
Elastic IP addresses - Static IPs for NAT Gateways

ðŸ› ï¸ Scalability

Smart CIDR planning - Room to grow (10.0.0.0/16 = 65,536 IPs)
Modular subnet design - Easy to add more tiers (database, cache)
VPC peering ready - Can connect to other VPCs
Transit Gateway compatible - Enterprise-scale networking

ðŸ’° Cost Awareness

NAT Gateway pricing - Per hour + data transfer ($0.045/hour + $0.045/GB)
Elastic IP costs - Only when unattached to instances
Data transfer optimization - Keep traffic within VPC when possible


ðŸš€ WHAT I LEARNED
Building this taught me:

CIDR block planning is critical - Can't change VPC CIDR easily after creation
Route tables are the brain - Every subnet needs correct routing
NAT Gateways cost money - One per AZ adds up fast ($65+/month)
Security Groups vs NACLs - Stateful vs stateless firewalls
Internet Gateway is shared - One IGW per VPC, attached to public subnets
Subnet sizing matters - AWS reserves 5 IPs per subnet (.0, .1, .2, .3, .255)


ðŸ“‹ TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION
Tech Stack

AWS VPC - Virtual network isolation
AWS Subnets - Public and private network segments
NAT Gateway - Outbound internet for private subnets
Internet Gateway - Inbound/outbound for public subnets
Route Tables - Traffic routing rules
Security Groups - Instance-level firewall
Network ACLs - Subnet-level firewall
Terraform - Infrastructure as Code
